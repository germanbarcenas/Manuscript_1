Figures of HOMO-LUMO or EPMs to show where electrons go. Cl should be donating e- to the system. We might think that its inclusion extends the conjugation of the system or in the particle in the box model, we've just increased the width of the box and red-shifted the system. Cl is also high electron affinity and electonegativity. Does this mean that Cl is pushing the box width with its electronegitity and it will readily accept more electons?  That seems to be the case, but is that just coincidental with the model in my head? Symmetry is broken, but that shouldn't be the story here.

HOMO-LUMO data
SQ5 maybe?
